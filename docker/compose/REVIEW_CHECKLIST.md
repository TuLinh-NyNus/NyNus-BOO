# Docker Build & Containerization - Review Checklist

## ðŸ“‹ Project Information
- **Project**: NyNus Exam Bank System
- **Task**: Docker Build & Containerization - Backend Only
- **Date**: 2025-10-16
- **Methodology**: RIPER-5 (RESEARCH â†’ PLAN â†’ EXECUTE â†’ TESTING â†’ REVIEW)
- **Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**

---

## âœ… RESEARCH Phase Checklist

- [x] Analyzed existing Docker configuration files
- [x] Reviewed monorepo structure (apps/backend, apps/frontend, packages/)
- [x] Identified services to containerize (Backend Go, PostgreSQL)
- [x] Confirmed Admin Dashboard is part of Frontend, not separate service
- [x] Analyzed dependencies and environment variables
- [x] Reviewed Prisma schema and database migrations
- [x] Used Augment Context Engine 10+ times for analysis
- [x] Documented findings in PLAN phase

**Key Findings**:
- Admin Dashboard is at `/3141592654/admin` route in Frontend
- Backend uses Go 1.23.0 with gRPC and HTTP Gateway
- PostgreSQL 15 required for database
- Frontend should run locally for better DX

---

## âœ… PLAN Phase Checklist

- [x] Defined services to containerize: Backend API (Go), PostgreSQL
- [x] Designed Docker network: `exam_bank_network` (bridge)
- [x] Designed volumes: `postgres_data` for persistence
- [x] Planned port mapping without conflicts:
  - PostgreSQL: 5433 (host) â†’ 5432 (container)
  - Backend gRPC: 50051
  - Backend HTTP: 8080
- [x] Created environment variables template
- [x] Verified no port conflicts with local services
- [x] Documented build order: PostgreSQL â†’ Backend
- [x] Created detailed subtasks for EXECUTE phase

**Architecture Decisions**:
- Frontend runs locally (not in Docker)
- Backend uses gRPC-Web for browser compatibility
- PostgreSQL port 5433 to avoid conflict with local installation

### Issues Resolved
- [x] **Issue 1**: Missing gRPC Gateway files (.gw.pb.go)
