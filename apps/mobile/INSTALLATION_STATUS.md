## ⏳ PENDING ITEMS

### 📥 Installation Required

#### 1. **Flutter SDK Installation** (⏳ Not Started)
```bash
# Required tools to install:
- Flutter SDK 3.24.0+
- Dart 3.5.0+ (comes with Flutter)
- protoc 3.24.0+ (Protocol Buffer Compiler)
- protoc-gen-dart (Dart proto generator)
```

**Status**: ❌ Not installed (due to Chocolatey permission issues)  
**Alternative**: Manual download from official sources  
**Estimated Time**: 15-20 minutes  
**File Size**: ~1.5 GB (Flutter) + 50 MB (protoc)

#### 2. **Proto File Generation** (⏳ Blocked by Flutter)
```bash
# Will run after Flutter is installed:
cd apps/mobile
./scripts/generate_proto_fixed.ps1
```

**Expected Output**:
- `lib/generated/proto/v1/*.pb.dart` (message definitions)
- `lib/generated/proto/v1/*.pbgrpc.dart` (service clients)
- `lib/generated/proto/common/*.pb.dart` (common types)

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 minutes

#### 3. **Backend Integration** (⏳ Blocked by Proto)
- Replace mock datasources with real gRPC calls
- Update repositories to use generated clients
- Test with running backend server
- Verify end-to-end data flow

**Estimated Time**: 10 minutes (after proto generation)

## 🚀 Installation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Environment Setup (⏳ BLOCKED)
```
Status: ❌ Blocked - Chocolatey permissions issue
Solution: Manual download or use alternative package manager

Steps:
1. Install Flutter SDK manually from flutter.dev
2. Install protoc manually from github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf
3. Install protoc-gen-dart: pub global activate protoc_plugin
4. Verify: flutter doctor, protoc --version

Duration: 15-20 minutes
```

### Phase 2: Proto Generation (⏳ PENDING)
```
Status: ⏳ Waiting for Phase 1
Command: ./scripts/generate_proto_fixed.ps1
Output: Dart proto client files
Duration: 2-3 minutes
```

### Phase 3: Backend Integration (⏳ PENDING)
```
Status: ⏳ Waiting for Phase 2
Steps:
1. Update datasource implementations
2. Replace mock calls with gRPC calls
3. Test with backend server running
4. Verify data flow end-to-end

Duration: 10 minutes
```

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (📋 READY)
```
Status: 📋 Ready to go
Steps:
1. Run flutter tests
2. Build APK/IPA
3. Deploy to devices
4. Monitor in production

Duration: Varies
```

## 📋 What's Ready RIGHT NOW

✅ **You can start running the app with mock data immediately!**

```bash
cd apps/mobile

# Install dependencies (if not done)
flutter pub get

# Run app with simulator/device
flutter run

# Test features:
- Login with any credentials (mock auth)
- Browse questions (mock data)
- Browse exams (mock data)
- View profile (mock data)
- Try library and theory pages
- Test all UI/UX features
```

---

## 🔄 After Installing Flutter

Once Flutter is installed, run this command:

```bash
cd D:\exam-bank-system
apps/mobile/scripts/generate_proto_fixed.ps1
```

This will:
1. Generate all Dart proto files
2. Create gRPC service clients
3. Update imports automatically
4. Enable real backend connectivity

## 📞 Installation Support

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: `flutter: command not found`
```bash
# Add to PATH in PowerShell
$env:PATH += ";C:\flutter\bin"
```

**Issue**: `protoc: command not found`
```bash
# Download from: https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases
# Extract and add to PATH
```

**Issue**: Proto generation fails
```bash
# Ensure you're in workspace root
cd D:\exam-bank-system

# Run with verbose output
