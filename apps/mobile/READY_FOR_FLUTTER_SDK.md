## ⏳ What's Needed

### **Only 1 Thing**: Flutter SDK Installation

**Why it's needed**:
- To run `flutter pub get` (install dependencies)
- To run `dart pub global activate protoc_plugin` (install proto plugin)
- To run proto generation scripts
- To build and run the app

**How to install**:
1. Download from: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows
2. Extract to `C:\flutter`
3. Add to PATH: `C:\flutter\bin`
4. Restart terminal
5. Run: `flutter doctor`

## 🚀 What Happens After Flutter SDK

### Automatic Process (5 minutes):

```bash
# Step 1: Install dependencies
cd apps/mobile
flutter pub get
# → Installs ~40 packages

# Step 2: Install proto plugin
dart pub global activate protoc_plugin
# → Installs protoc-gen-dart

# Step 3: Generate proto files
.\scripts\generate_proto.ps1
# → Generates ~72 Dart files from 18 proto files

# Step 4: Uncomment service code
# → Manual step using UNCOMMENT_GUIDE.md (~10 minutes)

# Step 5: Run code generation
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
# → Generates freezed/json_serializable code

# Step 6: Test
flutter test
# → Runs all tests

# Step 7: Run app
flutter run
# → App launches! 🎉
```
