## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Phase 2**: Implement gRPC integration
   - Generate client code from proto files
   - Setup gRPC channels
   - Create API repositories

2. **Phase 3**: Build authentication feature

## 💡 Tips

- Use barrel files (e.g., `import 'package:mobile/core/theme/theme.dart'`)
- Follow BLoC pattern for state management
- Keep features isolated in separate modules
- Write tests as you develop
- Run code generation after adding freezed/json_serializable annotations

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Flutter command not found
**Solution**: Add Flutter to your PATH or install Flutter SDK

### Issue: Dependencies not found
**Solution**: 
```bash
flutter pub cache repair
flutter clean
