# Backend Documentation Agent Guide
*Localised docs for Go backend deployment and operations*

## Scope
- Houses backend-specific documentation complementing `/docs`.
- Focus on deployment, runtime configuration, and operational policies.

## Contents
- `deployment/` â€” Guides for production hardening and infrastructure policies.

## Maintenance
- Sync updates with central docs (`docs/deployment/`) to avoid drift.
- Add READMEs for new topics (monitoring, profiling) as they mature.
