# Backend Cache Agent Guide
*Ephemeral storage for service-level cache artefacts*

## Purpose
- Holds runtime caches generated by backend workflows (images, processed assets, etc.).
- Keeps large intermediate files out of source directories.

## Structure
- `images/` â€” Cached renders and processed question images.

## Guidelines
- Treat contents as disposable; regenerate by rerunning associated jobs.
- Exclude from commits unless explicitly requested for diagnostics.
- Wipe with `make clean-cache` (if available) or manual deletion when stale.
