## 🟡 WARNINGS & LEGACY FILES

### **Legacy Workflows Found**

**Files:**
```
⚠️  ci.yml                  - OLD (superseded by ci-backend/frontend/mobile)
⚠️  backend.yml             - OLD (superseded by ci-backend.yml)
⚠️  frontend.yml            - OLD (superseded by ci-frontend.yml)
⚠️  proto-ci.yaml           - OLD (superseded by internal proto generation)
```

**Recommendation:** 
These legacy files should be kept as they may still be referenced, but the new workflows (ci-backend.yml, ci-frontend.yml, ci-mobile.yml) are the active ones.

**Action:** No immediate action needed - workflows will use latest versions.
