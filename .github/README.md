## 🚨 Important Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create Environments
```
GitHub > Settings > Environments

Create:
☑️ development (no approval, deploys from develop)
☑️ staging (no approval, deploys from main)
☑️ production-approval (1 reviewer, gatekeeping)
☑️ production (2+ reviewers, highly restricted)
```

See: [ENVIRONMENTS_SETUP.md](./ENVIRONMENTS_SETUP.md)

### Step 2: Configure Secrets
```
Repository Secrets (all workflows):
☑️ GITHUB_TOKEN (auto)
☑️ SLACK_WEBHOOK_STAGING
☑️ SLACK_WEBHOOK_PROD
☑️ CODECOV_TOKEN
☑️ SNYK_TOKEN

Environment Secrets (per environment):
☑️ AWS credentials
☑️ Kubernetes config
☑️ Deployment URLs
☑️ SSH keys
☑️ And more...
```

See: [SECRETS_SETUP.md](./SECRETS_SETUP.md)

### Step 3: Setup Branch Protection
```
Settings > Branches > Branch protection rules

For main branch:
☑️ 2 required reviews
☑️ All status checks required
☑️ Code owner approval
☑️ Up to date before merge

For develop branch:
☑️ 1 required review
☑️ Core status checks required
☑️ Code owner approval
```

See: [BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md](./BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md)

### Step 4: Enable Workflows
```bash
# Workflows are in .github/workflows/

# Verify they're visible:
GitHub > Actions > Should show 5 workflows

# Check status:
- Backend CI
- Frontend CI
- Mobile CI
- Deploy to Staging
- Deploy to Production
```

### Step 5: Test Everything
```bash
# Create test branch
git checkout -b test/cicd-setup

# Make a change
echo "test" >> README.md
git add .
git commit -m "test: verify CI/CD"
git push origin test/cicd-setup

# Create PR and verify:
# 1. All workflows run
# 2. All status checks appear
# 3. Cannot merge until all pass
# 4. Code owners requested (if configured)
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Running

```
Check:
1. Workflow file syntax is valid (YAML)
2. Workflow is enabled (Actions > Enable)
3. Triggers are correct (branch, event)
4. File path is correct (.github/workflows/*.yml)

Fix:
- Validate YAML: yamllint .github/workflows/ci-*.yml
- Check GitHub Actions tab for errors
- Review commit details (must match trigger)
```

### Status Check Failing

```
Check:
1. Job failed in workflow
2. Required secret missing
3. Dependency not installed

Fix:
- Review workflow log for error message
- Verify secrets in environment
- Check runner has required tools
```

### Cannot Merge PR

```
Causes:
1. ❌ Status checks not passing
2. ❌ Code reviews not approved
3. ❌ Conversations not resolved
4. ❌ Branch not up to date

Fix:
- Ensure all CI workflows pass
- Request reviewer approval
- Resolve conversations
- Update branch from main
```

### Secrets Not Found

```
Check:
1. Secret name matches exactly
2. Secret in correct environment (if environment-specific)
3. Workflow uses correct environment
4. Secret not masked incorrectly

Fix:
- Verify secret name in workflow
- Check GitHub settings > Secrets
- Ensure environment name matches
```
