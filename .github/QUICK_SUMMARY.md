## 🎯 When You Push Code

### **Expected Flow**
```
Push to main/develop
    ↓
5-10 seconds later: All workflows trigger
    ↓
Parallel execution:
├─ Backend CI (10-15 min)
├─ Frontend CI (15-20 min)
├─ Mobile CI (30-45 min)
├─ Security Scan (5-10 min)
└─ Deploy Staging (auto when tests pass)
    ↓
After all tests pass:
└─ Staging environment automatically deploys
    ↓
Production deployment (awaits manual approval)
```
