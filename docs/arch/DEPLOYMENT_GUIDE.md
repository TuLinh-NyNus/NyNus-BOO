## üì¶ DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Frontend Deployment (Immediate)

#### Step 1: Build and Test Locally

```bash
# Navigate to frontend
cd apps/frontend

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
pnpm install

# Build production bundle
pnpm build

# Test production build locally
pnpm start

# Verify at http://localhost:3000
```

#### Step 2: Run Linter and Type Checks

```bash
# Check for linting errors
pnpm lint

# Check TypeScript types
pnpm type-check

# Fix auto-fixable issues
pnpm lint --fix
```

#### Step 3: Deploy to Staging

```bash
# Using Vercel (recommended)
vercel --prod

# Or using your CI/CD pipeline
git push origin main  # Triggers auto-deployment
```

#### Step 4: Verify Deployment

Check these features in staging:
- [ ] Question preview modal opens correctly
- [ ] Question detail page shows real data
- [ ] Export dialog works (PDF and Word)
- [ ] Bulk edit modal opens (frontend only)
- [ ] Version history panel opens (frontend only)
- [ ] Cookie consent banner appears
- [ ] Dark mode toggle works
- [ ] Responsive design on mobile/tablet

---

### Backend Deployment (After Implementation)

#### Prerequisites
- [ ] Database migration ready
- [ ] gRPC endpoints implemented
- [ ] Unit tests passing (80%+ coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests passing

#### Step 1: Database Migration

```bash
# Connect to database
psql -h <host> -U <user> -d <database>

# Run migration for question_versions table
\i migrations/001_create_question_versions.sql

# Verify table created
\dt question_versions

# Verify trigger created
\df create_question_version
```

#### Step 2: Deploy Backend Service

```bash
# Build Go backend
cd apps/backend
go build -o bin/server ./cmd/server

# Run tests
go test ./... -v

# Deploy to staging
# (Your deployment process here)
```

#### Step 3: Verify Backend APIs

Test endpoints:
```bash
# Version Control
grpcurl -d '{"question_id": "test-id"}' \
  localhost:50051 question.QuestionService/GetVersionHistory

# Bulk Edit
grpcurl -d '{"question_ids": ["id1"], "status": "APPROVED"}' \
  localhost:50051 question.QuestionService/BulkUpdateQuestions

# Bulk Delete
grpcurl -d '{"question_ids": ["id1"]}' \
  localhost:50051 question.QuestionService/BulkDeleteQuestions
```
