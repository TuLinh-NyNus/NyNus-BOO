### Weaknesses (What Needs Improvement)

#### 1. Pattern Inconsistency ‚ö†Ô∏è
```
Issue: Response wrapper not used everywhere
Impact: Inconsistent error handling
Severity: Medium
Priority: High

Example:
- UserService: Uses common.Response ‚úì
- SearchService: Direct response ‚úó

Recommendation: Standardize on common.Response wrapper
Effort: Low (1-2 weeks)
```

#### 2. Missing Validation ‚ö†Ô∏è
```
Issue: No validation rules in proto
Impact: Runtime errors, data quality issues
Severity: Medium
Priority: High

Current: Manual validation in service layer
Needed: protoc-gen-validate integration

Recommendation: Add validation constraints
Effort: Medium (2-3 weeks)
```

#### 3. Service Overlap ‚ö†Ô∏è
```
Issue: LibraryService vs BookService
Impact: Confusion, duplicate logic
Severity: Low
Priority: Medium

Options:
A. Deprecate BookService ‚Üí LibraryService
B. Clear separation of concerns
C. Document boundaries

Recommendation: Option A (consolidate)
Effort: High (2-4 weeks)
```

#### 4. Documentation Gaps ‚ö†Ô∏è
```
Issue: Minimal proto file comments
Impact: Developer confusion, maintenance difficulty
Severity: Medium
Priority: Medium

Current: ~10% of RPCs documented
Target: 100% documentation

Recommendation: Documentation sprint
Effort: High (4-6 weeks)
```

#### 5. Limited HTTP Annotations ‚ö†Ô∏è
```
Issue: Only 2 of 18 services have annotations
Impact: Manual gateway configuration
Severity: Low
Priority: Medium

Current: AdminService, LibraryService only
Target: All public services

Recommendation: Add google.api.http annotations
Effort: Medium (2-3 weeks)
```

---

## üö® Critical Issues

### None Found ‚úÖ

No critical issues that would block production deployment were identified. The system is fundamentally sound.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Priority Issues

### 1. Large Message Sizes
```
Issue: Question message has 24 fields
Impact: Potential performance degradation
Files: question.proto

Recommendation: Monitor and consider splitting if needed
```

### 2. Oneof Complexity
```
Issue: Multiple oneof fields in Question
Impact: Complex client-side handling
Files: question.proto

Recommendation: Consider separate message types
```

### 3. Missing Streaming
```
Issue: Only SearchService uses streaming
Impact: Inefficient for large result sets
Files: Most services

Recommendation: Add streaming for pagination-heavy RPCs
```

  string email = 1 [(validate.rules).string.email = true];
  int32 age = 2 [(validate.rules).int32 = {gte: 0, lte: 150}];
```

#### 3. Document All Services
```yaml
Action: Add comprehensive proto comments
Files: All proto files
Effort: High (4-6 weeks)
