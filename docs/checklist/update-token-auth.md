## 📝 IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES FOR REMAINING PHASES

### Phase 3.2-3.5 Approach
1. **Network Monitoring**: Use `navigator.onLine` + fetch verification
2. **Sync Engine**: Process queue in priority order with retry logic
3. **UI Integration**: Show offline banner, sync progress indicator
4. **Testing**: Emulate network conditions, verify no data loss

### Phase 4 Approach
1. **Rule Engine**: Define detection rules (brute force, rapid requests, anomalies)
2. **ML Integration**: Consider ml.js or TensorFlow.js for anomaly scoring
3. **Dashboard**: Real-time threat display with manual response actions
4. **Backend Integration**: Coordinate detection & response execution

### Phase 5 Approach
1. **Metrics Collection**: Track token refresh patterns
2. **Real-Time Sync**: Use WebSocket for live updates
3. **Dashboard**: Charts for trends, insights for optimizations
4. **Export**: PDF/CSV generation with scheduled delivery
