type UnifiedJWTService struct {
    secret         string
    accessExpiry   time.Duration
    refreshExpiry  time.Duration
    issuer         string
}

// Consolidate these methods:

// - JWTService.GenerateAccessToken()
// - JWTService.GenerateRefreshToken()
```

### Context Simplification Strategy
```typescript
// Target simplified context structure
interface AuthContextType {
  // State
  user: User | null;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  isLoading: boolean;

  // Actions
  login: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  logout: () => Promise<void>;
  refreshToken: () => Promise<void>;
}

// Remove these split contexts:
// - AuthStateContext
// - AuthActionsContext
// Keep only: AuthContext
```

### Role System Standardization
```typescript
// Target role system (consistent across FE/BE)
enum UserRole {
  GUEST = "GUEST",
  STUDENT = "STUDENT",
  TUTOR = "TUTOR",
  TEACHER = "TEACHER",
  ADMIN = "ADMIN"
}

// Update protobuf enum to match
// Fix conversion functions
// Update middleware role checking
```

  });
});
```

#### Performance Testing Approach
```typescript
// Example performance test
describe('Auth Performance', () => {
  it('should login within 200ms', async () => {
    const start = Date.now();
    await authService.login(email, password);
    const duration = Date.now() - start;
    expect(duration).toBeLessThan(200);
  });
});
```

## üö® Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Rollback Plan
1. **Git Branching Strategy**
   - Create feature branch for each phase
   - Keep main branch stable
   - Use feature flags for gradual rollout

2. **Database Migration Safety**
   - Test migrations on copy of production data
   - Create rollback migrations for each change
   - Monitor database performance during migration

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Use environment variables for feature flags
   - Implement gradual configuration rollout
   - Monitor system health during changes

### Monitoring During Refactoring
1. **Key Metrics to Watch**
   - Login success rate (should stay >95%)
   - Average login response time (target <200ms)
   - Token validation performance (target <10ms)
   - Error rates (should not increase)

2. **Alert Thresholds**
   - Login failure rate >10%
   - Response time >500ms
   - Error rate >5%
   - Memory usage increase >50%

## üìä Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
