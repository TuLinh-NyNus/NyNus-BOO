## Blockers & Issues

### Current Blockers
- None

### Resolved Issues
- ✅ Identified tech stack mismatch (NestJS vs Go)
- ✅ Identified exam_type enum mismatch
- ✅ Identified extra fields in exams table

---

## Notes

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Tech Stack**: Confirmed Go backend with Raw SQL migrations is correct implementation
2. **Design Documents**: Need updating to reflect actual tech stack
3. **Migration Strategy**: Keep migration 000008 as fix, update 000004 for future reference

### Next Steps
1. Start Phase 2: PLAN - Create detailed action plans for each fix
2. Get user approval for Priority 1 fixes
3. Begin implementation of approved fixes
